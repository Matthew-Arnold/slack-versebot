# VerseBot

## What is VerseBot?
VerseBot is a Reddit bot that quotes Bible verses when asked.

## Usage
### Installation
First, you will want to install PRAW ([Python Reddit API Wrapper](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw)).
Once PRAW is installed, just load up the .py file in a text editor and make the following changes:

Next, you will want to edit the options for the bot by editing `config.ini`.

Once that's done, run `versebot.py` and it should be running fine!

### Triggering the bot
The syntax is now less strict than it was in the previous versions. Now, to trigger the bot all you have to do is post the verse in this format:

`<desired book> <desired chapter>:<(optional) desired verse>`
