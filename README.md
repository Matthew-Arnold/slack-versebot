# VerseBot

## What is VerseBot?
VerseBot is a Reddit bot that quotes Bible verses when asked.

## Usage
### Installation
First, you will want to install PRAW ([Python Reddit API Wrapper](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw)).
Once PRAW is installed, just load up the .py file in a text editor and make the following changes:

Next, you will want to edit the options for the bot by editing `config.ini`.

Once that's done, run versebot.py and it should be running fine!

### Triggering the bot
The correct syntax at the moment for triggering the bot in a Reddit comment is as follows:
`VerseBot: <desired book of Bible> <desired chapter>:<desired verse>.`
The syntax will likely be changed a bit in the future.
